  <h2 id="__data__-comes-from-curiosity"><strong>DATA</strong> comes from curiosity</h2>
<p>Learning is needed to exercise criticism.<br>Curiosity greatly improve the ability to learn.<br>Criticism is important because without it, you do not get wiser.<br>Curiosity starts by questioning and human created machines to ask them questions.   </p>
<p>Knowledge is data stored on machines but can only be processed by human.
Machines can help human at processing data but the processing of <strong>DATA</strong> needs a kind of criticism machines do not have yet.<br>It is one of the last advantages we have over machines.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-is-curiosity"><strong>DATA</strong> is curiosity</h2>
<p>A <strong>DATA</strong> work is based on data, collected, interpreted and represented with the feelings of individual human beings. </p>
<p>Machines can have senses, memory and perform complex tasks, therefore they are useful at collecting data but only human can really analyse <strong>DATA</strong> and react to feelings.</p>
<p>A <strong>DATA</strong> work is aimed to trigger curiosity, self-reflection and help gaining critical feelings.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-is-an-idea"><strong>DATA</strong> is an idea</h2>
<p>The formulation of a question is a question and <strong>DATA</strong> its answer.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-is-subjective"><strong>DATA</strong> is subjective</h2>
<p>Data is objective but is collected in subjective ways by humans willing to fulfill curiosity.
A <strong>DATA</strong> work is created by individuals, they all are unique.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-can-be-tangible"><strong>DATA</strong> can be tangible</h2>
<p>Unlike data, who is stored on machines, <strong>DATA</strong> can take shapes
and be put in relation with a tangible environment or human feelings.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-might-evolves"><strong>DATA</strong> might evolves</h2>
<p>Sustainability of <strong>DATA</strong> works is encouraged by sharing their plans and goals. 
This makes possible to adapt and reproduce a <strong>DATA</strong> work and follow its evolution from its source.</p>
<h2 id="__data__-is-the-capital"><strong>DATA</strong> is the capital</h2>
<p>The capital is what is owned at start. Whatever is made of it.</p>
