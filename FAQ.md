## What is __DATA__?
An idea.

## In clear text, what is __DATA__?
To summarize, it represents a kind of human made work based on and aimed to represent data.

## Where does the idea of __DATA__ come from?
The term dataism might already have been used for a [few](www.dataism.org) [projects](www.dataism.net) the most interesting and closer from the __DATA__ concept is maybe http://dataisms.net/ who has published something on [Friday, 19 September 2014 at 21:23:03](http://dataisms.net/feed/).

## What kind of data is a __DATA__ work using?
All kind, they are collected by the creator in a way or an other and then converted, or interpreted, into __DATA__.

## Do you have fun playing between "data" and "__DATA__"?
__DATA__ can be anything, fun as well.

## Is it only destinate to techies, nerds?
Hopefully not. 

## Where can I find examples of __DATA__ works?
If you have one, [create a page](https://github.com/zeropaper/__DATA__/wiki/_new) in this wiki and write a few lines about the concept.  
The very concept of [__DATA__](http://dataism.digital) is aimed to become a __DATA__ work (see the [why GitHub](#why-github)).

## Have those questions been really often asked?
Nope. Not yet. It's purely rethorical bullshit.

## Why GitHub?
GitHub is a platform for social coding who promote open source by offering great services to projects freely accessible.    
The idea of __DATA__ is be sustainable and improveable this is why it is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeropaper/__DATA__/).  
An other good reason is that version control systems generate a great amount of meaningful data (based on the evolution of the project it keeps track of) and those data can then be recycled into __DATA__.

## Where do we discuss the text of the manifest?
Post an [issue](https://github.com/zeropaper/__DATA__/issues/new) or fork it.

## Do you use hashtags?
Yes (erm... not yet, but soon), for instance, __DATAism__ or __DATAismassive__.

## License
[Good question](https://github.com/zeropaper/__DATA__/issues/2). Will probably released under [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.org).
