## What is DATA?
An idea.

## In clear text, what is DATA?
To summarize, it represents a kind of human made work based on and aimed to represent data.

## Where does the idea of DATA come from?
The term dataism might already have been used for a [few](www.dataism.org) [projects](www.dataism.net) the most interesting and closer from the __DATA__ concept is maybe http://dataisms.net/ who has published something on [Friday, 19 September 2014 at 21:23:03](http://dataisms.net/feed/).

## What kind of data is a DATA work using?
All kind, they are collected by the creator in a way or an other and then converted, or interpreted, into DATA.

## Do you have fun playing between "data" and "DATA"?
DATA can be anything, fun as well.

## Is it only destinate to techies, nerds?
Hopefully not. 

## Where can I find examples of DATA works?
If you have one, [create a page](https://github.com/zeropaper/DATA/wiki/_new) in this wiki and write a few lines about the concept.  
The very concept of [__DATA__](http://dataism.digital) is aimed to become a __DATA__ work (see the [why GitHub](#why-github)).

## Have those questions been really often asked?
Nope. Not yet. It's purely rethorical bullshit.

## Why GitHub?
GitHub is a platform for social coding who promote open source by offering great services to projects freely accessible.    
The idea of DATA is be sustainable and improveable this is why it is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeropaper/DATA/).  
An other good reason is that version control systems generate a great amount of meaningful data (based on the evolution of the project it keeps track of) and those data can then be recycled into __DATA__.

## Where do we discuss the text of the manifest?
Post an [issue](https://github.com/zeropaper/DATA/issues/new) or fork it.

## Do you use hashtags?
Yes (erm... not yet, but soon), for instance, _DATAism_ or _DATAismassive_.

## License
[Good question](https://github.com/zeropaper/DATA/issues/2). Will probably released under [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.org).
